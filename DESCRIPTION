Description: Predict Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions for UK Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), using Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and annual turnover data. The 'carbonpredict' package provides single and batch prediction, plotting, and workflow tools for carbon accounting and reporting. The package utilises pre-trained models, leveraging rich classified transaction data to accurately predict Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions for UK SMEs as well as identifying emissions hotspots. The methodology used to produce the estimates in this package is fully detailed in the following peer-reviewed publication in the Journal of Industrial Ecology: Phillpotts, A., Owen. A., Norman, J., Trendl, A.,  Gathergood, J., Jobst, Norbert., Leake, D. (2025) <doi:10.1111/jiec.70106> "Bridging the SME Reporting Gap: A New Model for Predicting Scope 1 and 2 Emissions".
