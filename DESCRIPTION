Description: Predict Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions for UK Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), using Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and annual turnover data, as well as Scope 1 carbon emissions for UK farms. The 'carbonpredict' package provides single and batch prediction, plotting, and workflow tools for carbon accounting and reporting. The package utilises pre-trained models, leveraging rich classified transaction data to accurately predict Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions for UK SMEs as well as identifying emissions hotspots. It also provides Scope 1 carbon emissions predictions for UK farms of types: Cereals ex. rice, Dairy, Mixed farming, Sheep and goats, Cattle & buffaloes, Poultry, Animal production and Support for crop production. The methodology used to produce the estimates in this package is fully detailed in the following peer-reviewed publication in the Journal of Industrial Ecology: Phillpotts, A., Owen. A., Norman, J., Trendl, A.,  Gathergood, J., Jobst, Norbert., Leake, D. (2025) <doi:10.1111/jiec.70106> "Bridging the SME Reporting Gap: A New Model for Predicting Scope 1 and 2 Emissions".
