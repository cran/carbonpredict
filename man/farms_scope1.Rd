\value{
A dataframe with predicted emissions (tCO2e)
}
\description{
This function loads a pre-trained emission model to predict scope 1 carbon emissions for a British farm.
The function predicts emissions for the following farm types: "Cereals ex. rice", "Dairy", "Mixed farming", "Sheep and goats", "Cattle & buffaloes", "Poultry", "Animal production", "Support for crop production".
